### About

This is a very simple and minimal R package that I wrote in order to query the Google QPX Flights API for flight information.
All the details can be found on the [project homepage](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/?authuser=1).

## UPDATE 2018

Sadly as of 10 April 2018 Google is discontinuing this nice project :-(  
It's a pity but I will try to find a similar free service and repurpose this package to use a different source. If you have any ideas or would like to collaborate on this - please fire up an issue in this repo.
